## Instructions for demos

The *Object-oriented programming and data analysis packages* tutorial is available in the three high-level, interpretive programming languages commonly used in earth science research: [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/), and [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) (note that Matlab does not really support object-oriented programming in the conventional sense of user-defined objects).

The Python and Julia notebooks can be run in two ways: via a ["binder"](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PraCTES/MIT-PraCTES/master?urlpath=lab) (an online, interactive environment that can be run directly in your browser) or by installing the language's core software on your personal machine, as well as any additional software packages (see how to do this on the [Introduction to programming](https://github.com/PraCTES/MIT-PraCTES/tree/master/demos/Lecture01_Intro_Programming) page).
