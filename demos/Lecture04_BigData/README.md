### Using `xarray` for analyzing N-dimensional labeled data, with `dask` working behind the scenes to make it all efficient for big data

This session has two separate tutorials:
1. a small-data tutorial for getting comfortable with using `xarray` for geophysical data analysis
2. a big-data tutorial for using `dask` and other tools to analyze big geophysical data sets on the cloud (or a properly configured HPC cluster)
