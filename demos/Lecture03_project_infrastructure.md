# Organizing version-controlled, reproducible, and efficient scientific projects

Here we will run through tools and methods you can use **now** to make your science & computations reproducible in the **future**. The final section (**DIY**) focuses on two representative, real-life examples and tools that were not covered but are worth your consideration.

## Now

- github & cloud services (guides, apps, organizations)
- documentation (md, jupyter, docstrings, ... rst, tex, ... PRs, issues)
- archiving (doi, zenodo, dataverse ... vs ftp, html, cloud hosting)
- version control (git, blame, commit, releases, ... pkg registry/manager)
- unit testing (ref result, formulate test, computer, ... automation, travis)

## Future

- maintainance & user support (issues, PRs, ... email, slack, etc)
- dependencies, collabs, modularity, coding practices, ... reuse vs recode, etc

## DYI

- Julia & diagnostic examples (`PkgTemplates.jl`, docs, tests, apps, ... `MeshArrays.jl`, `IndividualDisplacements.jl`, Forget & Ferreira 2019)
- MITgcm & ECCO examples (org, repo, doc, blame, issues, PRs, tests, upstream, ... ECCO, archives, doc, rerun, test)
- Check out these other tools: aws, docker, slack, overleaf, ...
