# Organizing version-controlled, reproducible, and efficient scientific projects

Here we will run through tools and methods you can use **now** to make your science & computations reproducible in the **future**. The final section (**DIY**) focuses on two representative, real-life examples and tools that were not covered but are worth your consideration.

Exercises and examples in this session focus on [github.com](http://github.com/) and related services. Ahead of our meeting, it is suggested that you create your own github account if you don't already have one. The [github guides](https://guides.github.com) provide very useful examples which we will rely on. Trying out the **Hello World** and **Mastering Markdown** guides would be a great way to get ready for Friday's session.

## Now

- github, git & cloud services (guides, apps, organizations)
	- [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- documentation (md, jupyter, docstrings, ... rst, tex, ... PRs, issues)
	- [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- archiving (doi, zenodo, dataverse ... vs ftp, html, cloud hosting)
	- [Making Your Code Citable](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)
- version control (git, blame, commit, releases, ... pkg registry/manager)
	- [git-handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
- unit testing (ref result, formulate test, computer, ... automation, travis)
	- [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com)

## Future

- maintainance & user support (issues, PRs, ... email, slack, etc)
	- [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
- dependencies, collabs, modularity, coding practices, ... reuse vs recode, etc
	- [Mastering Forks](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

## DYI

- Julia & diagnostic examples (`PkgTemplates.jl`, docs, tests, apps, ... `MeshArrays.jl`, `IndividualDisplacements.jl`, Forget & Ferreira 2019)
- MITgcm & ECCO examples (org, repo, doc, blame, issues, PRs, tests, upstream, ... ECCO, archives, doc, rerun, test)
- Check out these other tools: aws, docker, slack, overleaf, ...
