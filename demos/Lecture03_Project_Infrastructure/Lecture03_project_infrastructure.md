**Ahead of this session, it is suggested** that you create a [github.com](http://github.com/) account if you do not have one yet. The [github guides](https://guides.github.com) provide very useful examples. Our **Exercise #0** in fact is just their `Hello World` guide -- a great way to get ready.

**After this session, please consider** helping us improve the repo material by e.g. reporting potential bugs, typos, broken links, oversights, etc. via [our issue tracker](https://github.com/PraCTES/MIT-PraCTES/issues) or suggest changes via [pull requests](https://github.com/PraCTES/MIT-PraCTES/pulls). This repo itself is an example of the framework described in this session -- the project was built collectively and welcomes new contributors.

## 1. Set Up Your Project Using Version Control



- Introducing Github, which is basically: git (version control) + social networking + apps / cloud services
	- Get started with [GitHub](https://github.com/) & [command-line git](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) in **Exercise 0**
	- Get more familiar with command-line tools (**Exercises 1, 2**)
	- Examples of how organizations use Github: [MITgcm](https://github.com/mitgcm) (mature Fortran example), [JuliaDynamics](https://github.com/juliadynamics) (fairly mature Julia example), [JuliaClimate](https://github.com/JuliaClimate) (early stages of development Julia example)
	- Repository (_repo_) examples: [MITgcm repo](https://github.com/mitgcm/mitgcm), [JuliaDynamics repo](https://github.com/juliadynamics/agents.jl), [JuliaClimate repo](https://github.com/meta)
	- Application (_App_) examples: [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/authorizing-oauth-apps), [zenodo](https://zenodo.org), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)
	
_Linked repos should illustrate how pull requests, git commits, issue trackers, stars, etc provide user-friendly tools to collaborate on computational projects, document codes, their evolution, related discussions, etc., get feedback, bug reports, help, etc., ... from users, and maintain established capabilities through time. while software evolves and contributors may come and go. Don't hesitate to [get involved](https://guides.github.com/activities/socialize/) e.g. using [issue trackers](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)._

- Version Control: backing up your code in a structured way that fosters open-source collaboration
	- [Version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control); e.g. [git-handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) tutorial from GitHub
	- in **Exercise 3** you set up a practical collaborative framework for [the workshop repo](https://github.com/PraCTES/MIT-PraCTES)
	- [the github GUI](https://github.com/PraCTES/MIT-PraCTES) (e.g. file history, blame, commits, forks, PRs; see repo examples)
	- [semantic versioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning), GitHub releases, [Digital Object Idenfifier (DOI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier), e.g. [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org)
	- In **Exercise 4** you create a `Julia` package and set up version control for it.

_[Version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) is a widely used approach to documenting file changes through time. `git` is a big part of it but there is more to it!_

- Documentation: how to make your code readable, understandable, and extendable for users (including your future self!)
	- [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/); e.g., [MacDown app](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) for macOS
	- [Documenter.jl](https://juliadocs.github.io/Documenter.jl/stable/) & [docstrings](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/documentation/index.html) in Julia (for Python, see lecture 2; for Matlab / Octave see [1](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/add-help-for-your-program.html), [2](https://octave.org/doc/v4.0.1/Function-Headers.html#Function-Headers), [3](https://octave.org/doc/v4.0.1/Documentation-Tips.html))
	- [reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html) and [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org) as an alternative for e.g. a model [configuration](https://eccov4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) or [source code](https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

_Pull requests, issues, star, watch, etc. on [Github.com]() are also a form of documentation (e.g. in repo examples), as they transparently document bugs, updates, and various development choices that drive software changes._

_In **Exercises 1, 2** you already started doing version control using command line git. **Exercise 3** focuses on collaboration development, but version control can be useful for all sorts of shared or private repositories. After a while it may become a reflex to do it for all codes that you won't immediately throw away. This approach is very commonly used for packages (see below) and `git` is suitably designed for small text files (e.g., plain julia code). However, other services apply a similar approach to data sets (e.g., dataverse), papers (e.g., overleaf), and jupyter notebooks can be converted to plain code (e.g., jupytext)._

- Regression / unit testing: continuous component-by-component testing is key to developing robust and resilient code
	- in **Exercise 2** you run examples
	- in **Exercise 4** you make your own
	- automating tests, in the cloud, is made easy by e.g. [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com)

_[Regression testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing) often goes something like this: create reference result, formulate comparison with reference result, implement test & automate; check test results before comitting code changes (or merging a PR). This very common approach is often required for packages (see below). However, you can also do this to ensure that a model solution re-run  accurately reproduces the original (e.g., see [Forget et al. 2015](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/8/3071/2015/) & [this doc](https://eccov4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) or indeed for any other computation (e.g. in lecture 2)._

- Packages: to reach the stars (of scientific computing), stand on the shoulders of giants
	- Here is a [Julia example](https://github.com/gaelforget/IndividualDisplacements.jl). For `Python`, see lecture 2. For [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) / `Matlab` see [this doc](https://octave.org/doc/interpreter/Installing-and-Removing-Packages.html).
	- In **Exercise 4** you create, version control, upload, and archive a `Julia` package.
	- Section 2 touches on registries, archives, hosting, and continuous integration.
	- In `Julia`, we use [Pkg.jl](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/) & e.g.   [PkgTemplates.jl](https://invenia.github.io/PkgTemplates.jl/stable/). In `Python`, we use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), pip, etc.

_So-called environmments and compatibility constraints are general approaches to deal with dependencies across a galaxy of packages that may all evolve simultaneously in parallel. Packages are a bit of a special case but the same information can in principle be attached to any project. In this repo this information is put inside the `binder/` folder (e.g. in the `*.toml` files for `julia`). This allows `mybinder.org` to know what packages, and versions should be installed in the `jupuyterlab` instance so that all users have the same environment._

## 2. Maintain And Reproduce Your Project Results

- Archiving and registering: share your hard work with others â€“ and get some well-deserved credit!
	- [Making Your Code Citable](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)
	- [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ECCOv4r2) or [zenodo](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3461529) for data sets; archived = [D.O.I.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier)'ed
	- registering packages; e.g. `Julia` 's [package registries](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General) 
	- Julia registrator and tag bots / apps

_It's important to distinguish between simply hosting a data set and archiving it. An archive must have a permanent identifier and a long-term commitment by the host. This is what dataverse, or zenodo, provide and a crucial element to ensure long-term reproducibility. With this being said, simply making your project inputs and outputs publicly available is a great start! Cloud storage included in free plans from various cloud providers (e.g. dropbox, aws, & google) often suffice for small projects._
	
- Maintainance & user support: ensuring your code's life beyond its original use
	- [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) & [Mastering Forks](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
	- Keep up with pull requests & issues
	- Keep up with dependency updates
	- Regular, continued unit testing
	- Exploit debuggers [like this one](https://github.com/JuliaDebug/Debugger.jl)

_Collaborators, modularity, documentation, good coding practices, etc can all play an important role. The collaborative set up in **Exercise 3** often facilitates the integration of code updates between projects and across forks. It can also be important to choose your dependencies carefully -- e.g. you might want to assess whether it is likely that a given dependency will be well maintained / remain functional in the future before choosing whether you should use that dependency._

## 3. Self-Guided Exercises (using _binder_ cloud)

All of the exercises can be done using the cloud-based environment provided in the workshop material. Just hit the `binder` badge in the [workshop landing page](https://github.com/PraCTES/MIT-PraCTES) to get it started. 

This method is freely provided by [mybinder.org]() and it uses the [jupyterlab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) interface in your web browser (_tip: the Google Chrome browser seems to work best for this_). You can also use your own computer if that's more convenient though.

**List Of Exercises**

- 0. Hello GitHub World
- 1. Command Line Git
- 2. Command Line & Unit Tests
- 3. Practical Collaboration Setup
- 4. Create A Package And Collaborate
- 5. A Version-Controled Julia Project 
- 6. Track Changes Using Jupytext

### Exercise 0 -- Hello GitHub World

Follow the directions in the [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) guide. This guide will lead you to set up a [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) account and start using [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) for [Version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control). This framework is very widely used and the focus of this session. Further along in the _Hello World_ guide, you will learn to use `git` to track repositories (_repos_). You can think of repos as folders and dowload (_clone_) them to any computer. `GitHub.com` is something like `git` + social networking + apps / cloud services.

### Exercise 1 -- Command Line Git

In the `Jupyterlab` launcher pane click on `terminal`. A window should open where you will be able to type `shell` command lines. For example you can dowload / clone the workshop repository from `GitHub.com` like this:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/PraCTES/MIT-PraCTES
ls -la MIT-PraCTES/
```

The final command (`ls ...`) lists everything inside the local copy of `MIT-PraCTES/`. It should reveal a subfolder called `.git/` because version control has been set up for this repo. The `.git/` folder is where `git` operates its magic. The `binder/` folder is where we put information about the cloud environment that you are using. The `demos/` folder should contain the present file. etc.

Next, let's create a new folder (`mkdir test20200117`) and start tracking its contents (`git init`).

```
cd ~
mkdir test20200117
cd test20200117
ls -la
git init
ls -la
```

Typing the command `ls -la` before and after `git init` shows the appearance of the hidden `.git/` folder, which is where all of the internal files `git` uses to track changes live.

Now, we will add a file to the folder and commit it to the `git`'s memory. The following command The command `echo "Hi there" > readme` creates a short text file called `readme`; `git add` then tells `git` about it; and `git commit` records the content of the file -- at this point `readme` is now in the version control system. The final command `git commit -m "initial_commit"` should ask for a username and email at least once -- this is the key information that `git` uses for its book-keeping and to attribute authorship inside the `.git/` folder. Follow the instrucitons to configure `git` so that it knows who you are. (Note: Try `git status` before and after each of the commands -- the printed message should go from _Untracked_ to _new file_ to _nothing to commit_.)

```
echo "Hi ther" > readme
git add readme
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

Next, let's modify the new `readme` file by correcting the typo in the text and commit the changes. Open `readme` using the `jupyterlab` menu bar (`File > Open from Path... > test20200117/readme`), e.g. add an _e_ after _ther_, and save the modified file. Now go back to the terminal window and type `git commit readme`. You will be prompted to provide a `commit message` by the pre-installed [nano editor](https://www.nano-editor.org). Enter some text then hit `^X` to exit, `y` to confirm, and the `Return` key to finish.

Now you can reveal what has been recorded by the version control system using the `git log` command. A list of recent commits should appear -- there should be two at this point. Next to each `commit` in the list there is a long sort of code (an _hexadecimal_). If you copy it and paste after `git show ` then you should get more information about that commit.

To finish you can upload the repository you just created at the command line by following [these instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line). This invoves the `GitHub.com` GUI, and then `git remote` & `git push` at the command line. Note that you have already done the `git init` and `git commit` parts here.

### Exercise 2 -- Command Line & Unit Tests

##### Exercise 2.0: Numerical simulation unit test in the MITgcm (Fortran)
Download, compile, and run MITgcm on one of the unit tests:

```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/MITgcm/MITgcm
$ cd MITgcm/verification/
$ ./testreport -t advect_cs
```

##### Exercise 2.1: Software package unit tests for the MeshArrays.jl package (Julia)
Download a `Julia` package (e.g. `MeshArrays.jl`) from github and start julia.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gaelforget/MeshArrays.jl
$
$ julia
               _
   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org
  (_)     | (_) (_)    |
   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type "?" for help, "]?" for Pkg help.
  | | | | | | |/ _` |  |
  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 1.3.1 (2019-12-30)
 _/ |\__'_|_|_|\__'_|  |  Official https://julialang.org/ release
|__/                   |
julia> 
```

This is the basic julia mode where you can execute operations (e.g. try `julia> 1+1` & the `Return` key). One can access the package manager mode by typing the `]` key. Then `pkg> add MeshArrays.jl` & the `Return` key will add the chosen package to the `Julia` environment. 

In package manager mode (`]`), one can then run the unit tests for this package using `test MeshArrays`. If all unit tests were successful, the final display should look something like this:

```
   Testing MeshArrays
 Resolving package versions...
    Status `/tmp/jl_8pEyMo/Manifest.toml`
  [81a5f4ea] CatViews v1.0.0
  [cb8c808f] MeshArrays v0.2.4
...
Test Summary:     | Pass  Total
MeshArrays tests: |   15     15
   Testing MeshArrays tests passed 
```

To leave the package mode and go back to the basic `julia>` prompt hit the `Esc` keystroke (or `Backspace` / `Delete` if that does not work). You can then start using the `Mesharrays.jl` package that we just been added. For example:

```
julia> using MeshArrays
julia> (Rini,Rend,DXCsm,DYCsm)=MeshArrays.demo2()
julia> show(Rend)
```

To access the documentation of a function in Julia one can just type `?` followed by e.g. the name of the package / module followed by the function name (e.g. `?MeshArrays.demo2`). This will print out the `docstring` which is inside the package code, just next to the `demo2` function definition (see [the julia docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/documentation/index.html) for detail).

```
help?> MeshArrays.demo2
  demo2()

  Demonstrate higher level functions using smooth. Call sequence:

  (Rini,Rend,DXCsm,DYCsm)=MeshArrays.demo2();
```

Now let's look inside the Julia package we have downloaded. We see a `.git` as before but also a documentation folder, `docs/`, and the `src/` folder where the code is. The `*.toml` files document the package dependencies and the `.travis.yml` file is used to automate the unit testing via the [https://travis-ci.org/]() cloud service. 

```
$ ls -la MeshArrays.jl/
total 52
...
drwxr-xr-x 4 jovyan root   4096 Jan 17 14:50 docs
drwxr-xr-x 8 jovyan root   4096 Jan 17 14:50 .git
-rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan root     82 Jan 17 14:50 .gitignore
-rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan root   1163 Jan 17 14:50 LICENSE.md
-rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan root   1429 Jan 17 14:50 Manifest.toml
-rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan root    464 Jan 17 14:50 Project.toml
-rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan root   2457 Jan 17 14:50 README.md
-rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan root     10 Jan 17 14:50 REQUIRE
drwxr-xr-x 2 jovyan root   4096 Jan 17 14:50 src
drwxr-xr-x 2 jovyan root   4096 Jan 17 14:50 test
-rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan root   1430 Jan 17 14:50 .travis.yml
```

If you go to the [repo on github.com](https://github.com/gaelforget/MeshArrays.jl) then the landing page should show a `README.md` (scroll down maybe) with a `build` badge. Clicking on this badge will get you to the results of automated unit tests generated using the [https://travis-ci.org/]() cloud service. The docs badge will in turn lead you to the [hosted documentation](https://gaelforget.github.io/MeshArrays.jl/stable/) based on what's in `docs/`.

To take this exercise a git further, let's now install a registered package by typing `]` then `add IndividualDisplacements.jl`. Notice that `julia`'s package manager takes care of the `git clone` part for registered packages. Wondering where the package got downloaded? Press `esc` then type `pathof(IndividualDisplacements)` to find out.

Finally:

- To display the list of packages currently installed : type `]` then `status` (or `st` for short).
- To remove a package from `julia` : `]` then e.g. `rm IndividualDisplacements.jl `. 

### Exercise 3 -- Practical Collaboration Setup

The approach described in the [MITgcm manual](https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/contributing.html) typical of a practical and collaborative model. The basic configuration is depicted below and your exercise is to set this up for this workshop's own repo, `https://github.com/PraCTES/MIT-PraCTES`. 

To this end, you will first fork (github), clone (terminal), and branch (terminal) [as explained here](https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/contributing.html). Then, in the terminal window, execute the following command:

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/PraCTES/MIT-PraCTES`

This will allow you to 

- 1. modify files (such as the code demos) and **commit** these changes to your **local branch** (on your laptop, e.g. all offline)
- 2. **push** your branch back to your repo on `Github.com` and possibly see your changes **merged in the upstream repo** repo via a **pull request**.

But imagine a scenario where multiple people are doing this and code changes happen in the main repo while you were in the middle of doing your changes to the code? No panic -- that is why the schematic below shows a connection between upstream and your local clone. 

The `pull upstream` command effectively brings the latest updates from the main repo to your local copy / clone. This will then allow you to **merge** these updates from upstream into your local branches, and then push them to your online repo (see [this doc](https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/contributing.html)). We will do this in **Exercise #4b** using a practice repo.

<img src="https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/git_setup.svg" width="50%">

### Exercise 4a -- Create a Julia package

Create a julia package, add tests, add docs, and push to your github account following [this guide](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/creating-packages/)

### Exercise 4b -- Collaborate on packages

Let's re-use your repos from **Exercise 4a** and use them to try out collaborative development mechanisms.

- 1. Pair up with another workshop attendee
- 2. Proceed as in **Exercise 3** using their repo as `main repo` (and vice versa for them).
- 3. In your clone of their repo, create a branch, add a new file, and `git commit`.
- 4. Use `git push` and `Pull Request` to submit your proposed changes to them. The `PR` should point from the modified branch in your fork to the master branch in the main repo on `GitHub.com`.
- 5. They can now `merge` your pull request into their `master` branch.
- 6. To finish you want to update the `master` branch in your fork as [explained here](https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/contributing.html).

_Note: you can also do the command-line git part using your own laptops._

### Exercise 5 -- A Version-Controled Julia Project  

Here is a Julia code sample where we define a new `xy` type and then redefine `sum` for this new type. This corresponds to what was done in lecture 2 in Python where we defined objects and methods. **In this exercise** we will turn this code snippet into a version-vontroled project hosted on `github.com` and easily reproduced on `mybinder.org`.

```
#Define a new data type with two real numbers
struct xy
	a::Float64
	b::Float64
end

#Define a variable of the new data type
ab=xy(1.0,2.0)
typeof(ab)
show(ab)

#The following command would return an error message at this point 
#because julia does not now yet how to compute the sum of ab
#sum(ab)

#We want to define a special version of the sum function 
#that applies when the input type is `xy` (`::xy` in Julia) 
import Base:sum
function sum(ab::xy)
	ab.a+ab.b
end

#Now this works:
sum(ab)
```       

_In Julia terminology, the function `sum` in the provided example disptaches to the method where the type of the sole input is annotated as `xy`. Notice how this resembles but also differs from what we did in lecture 2 in Python. Some of the key aspects in which `Julia` differs from `Python` include: functions v objects, multiple dispatch, type annotations, broadcasting. But there are also lots of similarities._

##### Exercise 5.0
- open a julia notebook
- copy the above code in the notebook
- Verify at the end that `sum(xy(1.0,2.0))==3.0` is true
- save to file (e.g. `xysum.ipynb` could be its name)

##### Exercise 5.1
- open a terminal window 
- create a new folder, move `xysum.ipynb` to this folder
- copy the `binder/*.toml` files to the new folder
- setup version control (`git`) for this folder
- git add and commit the folder's three files

##### Exercise 5.2
- create a new repo on `GitHub.com`
- `git push` your project to this `github.com` repo
- rerun the project using `mybinder.org` & the `github.com` repo
- take a minute to celebrate? 

##### Exercise 5.3

Let's add another type and method to your project. Now we want to plot a curve and set the vertical axis range automatically -- based on the `min` and `max` embeded in each `RangeArray` instance.

- In a new notebook, first add the `Plots.jl` package and the `RangeArray` type (see below).
- Create a special version of the `plot` function for the `RangeArray` type.
- Add a docstring juat before the new `plot` method is defined.
- Provide a visual example of the new `plot` method working at the end.
- Then proceed as in `5.1` & `5.2`

```
struct RangeArray
	arr::Array
   	min::Float64
   	max::Float64
end
```

### Exercise 6 -- Track Changes Using Jupytext

Install and try [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) in the Jupyter lab environments or on your laptop. Using the paired _light scripts_ appraoch where `.jl` files are kept in sync with your notebooks (as in [this example](https://github.com/gaelforget/MeshArrayNotebooks)) can make it easier to trace back changes made to jupyter notebooks using `git` and `github`.

## 4. Examples From EAPS & collaborators (incl. Models & Papers)

Here we focus on examples that we know well and feel illustrate some of the the approaches outlined in this lecture -- each example in its own, often imperfect ways. Many, many other examples are available on `GitHub.com` and elsewhere. Every project may do things slightly differently, so it's great look around for other examples. Don't hesitate to open an issue on the [workshop repo](https://github.com/PraCTES/MIT-PraCTES) if you find a good example you'd like to see listed in this doc.

- The [MIT general circulation model](http://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) (`MITgcm`) is a widely used numerical model that simulates the Ocean circulation and related processes. It has been developed collaboratively by a community distributed around the world over 20+ years. Lead developer @jm_c and the community at large have been maintaining the model functionalities and reproducing its reference results all along (e.g. **Exercise 2**), while revising and extending the code base at the same time, and continuously welcoming new contributors.
- [ECCO version 4](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/8/3071/2015/) is a global ocean state estimation framework that uses `MITgcm` as a dependency. Here `GitHub.com` etc is used to provide and document the [model configuration](https://eccov4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest). This allows anyone with access to e.g. a small cluster to easily rerun realistic model solutions generated as far as now 4 years ago. The repo also includes a testing mechanism to verify that reruns reproduce the original solution accurately. The model input, as needed to rerun `ECCOv4r2` using `MITgcm`, is permanently archived in the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ECCOv4r2) along with the reference model output from 2016.
- [Forget & Ferreira 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-019-0333-7) is a study that in turn uses `ECCOv4r2` output as a dependency. The new study results were also archived in [this dataverse](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/AVVGYX) and the [Helmholtz Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_decomposition) method needed to recreate the new results is now available both in [this Matlab / Octave package](https://gcmfaces.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and in [this Julia package](https://gaelforget.github.io/MeshArrays.jl/stable/). Try it out e.g. using [binder](https://mybinder.org/) and notebooks [in this repo](https://github.com/gaelforget/MeshArrayNotebooks)!
- [Hausfather, Drake, Abbott, & Schmidt 2019](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL085378) is another example that relies on a different set of dependencies. Here the authors evaluate the performance of past climate model projections. [This repository](https://github.com/hausfath/OldModels) contains the notebooks, scripts, and data that correspond to the analysis in the paper. `Python` dependencies are listed in the `environment.yml` in this case. Hence you can again use `binder` to rerun the analysis in the cloud.

In any of the examples, and beyond, you are very welcome to get involved. For example, please consider:

- using the **watch**, **star**, or **fork** functionalities on the `github.com` repos.
- contributing via the repo `issue trackers` (for questions, bug reports, etc).
- helping maintain, improve, or extend these projects via `forks` and `pull requests`.
