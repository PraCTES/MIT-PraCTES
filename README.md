## MIT Practial Computing Tutorials for Earth Scientists (PraCTES)

The PraCTES workshop is a series of demos and hands-on tutorials for practical computing *by earth scientists* and *for earth scientists*. 

Each two-hour session will be highly interactive: instructors will swap between presenting background information on topics (e.g. What is an Earth System Model? How does github work behind the scenes?), demonstrating computing concepts with live demos and leading hands-on code tutorials and exercises, which attendees can follow along with live on their laptops.
